The data was retrieved by [TwitterScraper API ](https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper). 
We retrieved about 13,000 tweets each day from Jan. 20th to April 8th (80 days), using search query "#COVID2019 OR #COVID19 OR coronavirus". The total tweets we obtained is 1,100,069 tweets. 
The raw dataset can be found in the "Raw Data" folder.
Due to the file size limitation of Github, the combined dataset need to be found in 
[Google Drive](drive link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dqChbCDq0UrMq59pn4oATe_gqZ5ZERx1?usp=sharing  ).
